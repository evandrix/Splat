<p>The dexml project has a website!</p>

<p>Yes, I've finally gotten around to finding a website/documentation toolchain that works for me.  This means I'm going to be writing and expanding a tutorial, providing FAQs, and other fun things that just don't fit into the PyPI package page.</p>

<p>FYI, the hosting is provided by the <a href="http://packages.python.org/">cheeseshop</a>.  The site is built using a combination of <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">sphinx</a> for the API docs and tutorial, and <a href="http://hyde.github.com/">hyde</a> for the general layout and management.</p>
