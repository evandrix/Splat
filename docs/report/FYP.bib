	object-oriented systems using a genetic programming approach. It
	is believed that this approach is advantageous over the more established
	search-based test-case generation approaches because the test software
	is represented and altered as a fully functional computer program.
	Genetic programming (GP) uses a tree-shaped data structure which
	is more directly comparable and suitable for being mapped instantly
	to abstract syntax trees commonly used in computer languages and
	compilers. These structures can be manipulated and executed directly,
	bypassing intricate and error prone conversion procedures between
	different representations. In addition, tree structures make more
	operations possible, which keep the structure and semantics of the
	evolving test software better intact during program evolution, compared
	to linear structures. This speeds up the evolutionary program generation
	process because the loss of evolved structures due to mutations and
	crossover is prevented more effectively.},

  abstract = {Domain testing is a well-known software testing technique. Although
	research tasks have been initiated in domain testing, automatic test
	data generation based on character string predicates has not yet
	been reported. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically
	generate ON-OFF test points for character string predicate borders
	associated with program paths, and describes a corresponding test
	data generator control flow based testing Slices with respect to
	predicates on paths are constructed to calculate the current values
	of variables in the predicates via program slicing techniques. Each
	character element of variables in a character string predicate is
	dynamically determined in turn by function minimization so that the
	ON-OFF test points for the predicate border can be automatically
	generated. The preliminary experimental results show that this approach
	is promising and effective.},
