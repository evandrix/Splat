2.1.1 Composing vs. Connecting</A>
</H2>

<P>
Imagine a car.  It's composed from a variety of parts: the wheels, engine,
battery, frame, and so on.  Some of these parts are also composed of parts:
the engine has a block, cylinders, pistons, spark plugs, and so on.

<P>
Each part in this ``component assembly" can be a part of only one larger part:
its <b>parent component</b>.  The hubcaps are part of the wheels,
and so they can't also be part of the engine.  (They wouldn't fit there in
any case, but that's beside the point.)  Consider that screws or bolts may
be used in many parts of the car: each is part of only one other part of
the car, although more than one of the same <i>kind</i> of part may be used
in other places.  In the UML (Unified Modelling Language) and in PEAK, this
kind of parent-child ``assembly" relationship  is called <b>composition</b>:
a component is being ``composed" by assembling other components.

<P>
But in the UML and in real life, this isn't the only way of building things
with components.  It would be very inefficient if every light and accessory
in your car had to have its own, independent electrical system.  Ways of
<i>sharing</i> components are needed.  In the car, wires, pipes, hoses, and
shafts serve to <i>connect</i> the services provided by shared components to
the places where they are needed.  Note that such connections may be between
components at any level: wires carry electricity to every electrical part, no
matter how big or small.  In some cases, wires go to a major subsystem, which
then has internal wires to carry electricity inward to its parts, or to carry
signals between its parts.  In  the UML, these kind of ``shared" or
``peer-to-peer" connections are called <b>associations</b>.
