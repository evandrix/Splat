\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent First of all, I would like to thank Professor Susan Eisenbach for supervising my project, and giving me invaluable advice and guidance throughout my work. I also thank Tristan Allwood for his support, ideas, encouragement, and the useful discussions we had about my project. \\

\noindent Secondly, I thank John Ayres for creating the original Stage, a language which has been incredibly well thought out and, during my use of it, has proved very robust. John has given me many useful suggestions and critique regarding Stage. \\

\noindent Also, I thank Namit Chadha for several discussions about our actor-based projects, and I thank John Field of IBM research for providing me with information about the Thorn language. \\

\noindent Many thanks to Chong-U Lim for his insight during our conversations. \\

\noindent Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their continued full support while I am at university.
