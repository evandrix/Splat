\begin{abstract}

\noindent

PEAK, the ``Python Enterprise Application Kit", offers unique tools for
creating ``enterprise" applications from components.  ``Building
Component-Based Applications with PEAK" introduces Python developers to
the basic techniques for using the PEAK binding, naming, and config
packages to build flexible, reusable, and configurable components, and
to assemble them into large-scale applications.

%  The ugly "%begin{latexonly}" pseudo-environments are really just to
%  keep LaTeX2HTML quiet during the \renewcommand{} macros; they're
%  not really valuable.
%
%  If you don't want the Module Index, you can remove all of this up
%  until the second \input line.
