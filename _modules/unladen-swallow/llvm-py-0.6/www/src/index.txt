llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler backend or a VM in pure Python. llvm-py consists of
Python and C modules that wrap over the native C++/C bindings of LLVM,
and does not use / have dependencies on "glue utilities" like
Boost.Python, swig etc.

llvm-py is available as a source package (only). It works / should work
with GNU/Linux, *BSD and Mac OS X platforms, on both 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures. Python 2.4 or better (but 3.x is untested) is required.
The SVN HEAD usually works with the latest released LLVM. In case you
discover that any of these claims are wrong, feel free to send across
a patch.
