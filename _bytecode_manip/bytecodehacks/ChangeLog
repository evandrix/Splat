	* bytecodehacks/code_gen/write_ops.py: Use new stack tracking
	stuff.

	* bytecodehacks/code_gen/stack_bump_methods: manipulate_stack
	methods for ops.py.

	* bytecodehacks/code_editor.py: Another attempt at getting the
	stack size calculation right; I think this one is at least
	conceptually right, though it may be wrong in details.  Sundry
	other tweaks.

	* bytecodehacks/xapply.py: Major rewrite; now more robust,
	supports keyword arguments, munges default argument lists
	correctly, handles writes to parameters and issues sensible error
	messages (well, some of the time).

	* *: Added a licence.

1999-11-15  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* bytecodehacks/assemble.py: It's an assembler for Python! Just
	what you always needed! No docs yet; see test/assdemo.pya for a
	hint.

	* *: distutils-ized; moved stuff about to support this.

1999-11-14  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* code_editor.py: calculate co_stacksize automatically. added
	extend to CodeString.

	* doc/bch.tex: documented code_gen/*; corrected the odd typo.

	* code_gen/*: substantially rewritten.

	* ooh! bytecodhacks has new life!

	ChangeLog up to date, sorry.

1999-05-15  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* inline.py: Substantially rewritten to use find_function_call,
	and to support keyword arguments. No varags yet.

	* inline.py: Python now has inline functions! Bet you never
	expected that.

	* It's all changing again! Much polish, some docstrings,
	everything rewritten to use code_editor that wasn't already, many
	style fixes.

1999-05-06  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* attr_freeze.py: implement an attribute freezer that works.

	* xapply2.py: implement xapply for functions (again!) using the
	new code editing framework from code_editor.py.

	* code_editor.py: That's more like it!

1999-05-04  Michael Hudson  <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>

	* attr_freeze.py: implements a (buggy) attempt at freezing
	attribute references.

	* read_code.py,opbases.py,ops.py,write_ops.py,
	common.py,__init__.py: Much stuff added/changed. It not pretty or
	internally consistent yet. I might bash on it some more some

	either.
