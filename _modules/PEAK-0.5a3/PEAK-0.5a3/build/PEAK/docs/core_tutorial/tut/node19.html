2.1.1.1 Implementing Components in Python and PEAK</A>
</H3>

<P>
In the Python language, components are Python objects, and composition and
association relationships are represented using objects' attributes.  Using
the <tt class="module">peak.binding</tt> package, you'll create <b>attribute bindings</b>
that  define what sub-objects will be created (via composition) or external
objects  will be referenced (via association) by each attribute of a component.

<P>
Of course, there are some important differences between software and the real
world.  In the real world, we have to actually build every part of the car
``ahead of time", and we must have one screw for every place a screw is needed.
In software, classes let us define the concept of a ``screw" once and then use
it as many times as we want, anywhere that we want.

<P>
Also, with PEAK, bindings are ``lazy".  What this means is that we can define
an ``engine" class whose parts aren't actually created until they're needed.
We just list the parts that are needed and what attributes they'll be bound
to, and when the attribute is used, the part is automatically created or
connected, according to our definition.

<P>
Since each part ``magically" appears the first time we want to use it, it's
as though it was always there.  It's as if your car was an empty shell until
you opened the door or looked in the window, at which point all the contents
magically appeared.  And then when you got into the car, the radio was just
an empty shell until you tried to turn it on, at which point all of its
internal components sprang into being and wired themselves together.

<P>
This ``lazy" construction technique can speed startup times for applications
which are built from large numbers of components, by not creating all the
objects right away, and by never creating objects that don't get used during
that application run.
