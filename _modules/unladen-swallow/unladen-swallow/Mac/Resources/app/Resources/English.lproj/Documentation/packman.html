<h1>Installing additional Python Packages</h1>

				<p>The Python Package Manager helps you installing additional
				packages that enhance Python. It determines the exact MacOS version
				and Python version you have and uses that information to download
				a database that has packages that are test and tried on that
				combination. In other words: if something is in your Package Manager
				window but does not work you are free to blame the database maintainer.</p>
				
				<p>PackageManager then checks which of the packages you have installed
				and which ones not. This should also work when you have installed packages
				outside of PackageManager.
				You can select packages and install them, and PackageManager will work 
				out the requirements and install these too.</p>
				
				<p>Often PackageManager will list a package in two flavors: binary
				and source. Binary should always work, source will only work if
				you have installed the Apple Developer Tools. PackageManager will warn
				you about this, and also about other external dependencies.</p>
				
				<p>PackageManager is available as a separate application and also
				as a function of the IDE, through the <tt>File-&gt;Package Manager</tt> menu
				entry. </p>
				
				<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
				
				<p>If package manager fails to open the database first check that you are
				connected to the internet. If you are connected then the problem
				could be that there is no database (yet?) for your version of Mac OS X.
				You may be able to find an alternative
				database that works for your system at
				<a href="http://www.python.org/packman">http://www.python.org/packman</a>.
				In the standalone Package Manager you can then open such an alternative database
				with the <tt>File-&gt;Open URL...</tt> command, but you should realize that
				you are now on untested ground.</p>
				
				<p>Another potential problem source is that you are behind a firewall. This version
				of PackageManager uses the Unix method of setting a firewall: you need to set the
				environment variable <tt>http_proxy</tt> to <tt>"http://<i>proxyhost</i>:<i>port</i>"</tt>.
				See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html">Apple Technical
				Q&amp;A QA1067</a> for instructions.</p>
