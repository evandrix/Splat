Installing Dexml
================

Windows Users
-------------

Download the pre-built Windows installer from the download page and run it to install dexml. It will place the 'dexml' module in your Python site-packages directory.

There is a single installer for all versions of Python.


Mac OS X Users
--------------

Download the pre-built OSX installer from the download page and execute it in the finder. It will place the 'dexml' module in your Python site-packages directory.

There are also eggs available for users who prefer them.


Other Platforms
---------------

Your operating system distributor may provide dexml via their own packaging system - please check there first.

If a package is not provided by your operating system distributor, you will need to install from source.

     1. :doc:`Download<download>` and untar the source files.
     2. Enter the distribution directory, which contains the file 'setup.py'.
     3. Execute the command::

            python setup.py install

     4. Please refer to the `distutils documentation <http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html>`_ for help on installing Python modules in this manner.
