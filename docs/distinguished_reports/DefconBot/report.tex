%\begin{abstract}
% As games become technologically more advanced with the ages, there's never been a greater need for intelligent AI in games. Several methodologies exist, with the aim of making AI more human-like, making games more engaging and believable. From the days of using Finite State Machines to Hierarchical Logic, the different ways of approaching AI have substantially made AI more diverse. Behavior Trees attempt to improve upon these techniques by allowing a modular, flexible and powerful architecture that is goal-orientated.
