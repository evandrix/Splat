"""Generate and test for small primes using a variety of algorithms
implemented in pure Python.

This module includes functions for generating prime numbers, primality
testing, and factorising numbers into prime factors. Prime numbers are
positive integers with no factors other than themselves and 1.


Generating prime numbers
========================

To generate an unending stream of prime numbers, use the ``primes()``
generator function:

    primes():
        Yield prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...


    >>> p = primes()
    >>> [next(p) for _ in range(10)]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]


To efficiently generate pairs of (isprime(i), i) for integers i, use the
generator functions ``checked_ints()`` and ``checked_oddints()``:

    checked_ints()
        Yield pairs of (isprime(i), i) for i=0,1,2,3,4,5...

    checked_oddints()
        Yield pairs of (isprime(i), i) for odd i=1,3,5,7...


    >>> it = checked_ints()
    >>> [next(it) for _ in range(5)]
    [(False, 0), (False, 1), (True, 2), (True, 3), (False, 4)]


Other convenience functions wrapping ``primes()`` are:

    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------
    Function            Description
    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------
    nprimes(n)          Yield the first n primes, then stop.
    nth_prime(n)        Return the nth prime number.
    prime_count(x)      Return the number of primes less than or equal to x.
    primes_below(x)     Yield the primes less than or equal to x.
    primes_above(x)     Yield the primes strictly greater than x.
    primesum(n)         Return the sum of the first n primes.
    primesums()         Yield the partial sums of the prime numbers.
    ------------------  ----------------------------------------------------


Primality testing
=================

These functions test whether numbers are prime or not. Primality tests fall
into two categories: exact tests, and probabilistic tests.

Exact tests are guaranteed to give the correct result, but may be slow,
particularly for large arguments. Probabilistic tests do not guarantee
correctness, but may be much faster for large arguments.

To test whether an integer is prime, use the ``isprime`` function:

    isprime(n)
        Return True if n is prime, otherwise return False.


    >>> isprime(101)
    True
    >>> isprime(102)
    False


Exact primality tests are:

    isprime_naive(n)
        Naive and slow trial division test for n being prime.

    isprime_division(n)
        A less naive trial division test for n being prime.

    isprime_regex(n)
        Uses a regex to test if n is a prime number.

        .. NOTE:: ``isprime_regex`` should be considered a novelty
           rather than a serious test, as it is very slow.


Probabilistic tests do not guarantee correctness, but can be faster for
large arguments. There are two probabilistic tests:

    fermat(n [, base])
        Fermat primality test, returns True if n is a weak probable
        prime to the given base, otherwise False.

    miller_rabin(n [, base])
        Miller-Rabin primality test, returns True if n is a strong
        probable prime to the given base, otherwise False.


Both guarantee no false negatives: if either function returns False, the
number being tested is certainly composite. However, both are subject to false
positives: if they return True, the number is only possibly prime.


    >>> fermat(12400013)  # composite 23*443*1217
    False
    >>> miller_rabin(14008971)  # composite 3*947*4931
    False


Prime factorisation
===================

These functions return or yield the prime factors of an integer.

    factors(n)
        Return a list of the prime factors of n.

    factorise(n)
        Yield tuples (factor, count) for n.


The ``factors(n)`` function lists repeated factors:


    >>> factors(37*37*109)
    [37, 37, 109]


The ``factorise(n)`` generator yields a 2-tuple for each unique factor, giving
the factor itself and the number of times it is repeated:

    >>> list(factorise(37*37*109))
    [(37, 2), (109, 1)]


Alternative and toy prime number generators
===========================================

These functions are alternative methods of generating prime numbers. Unless
otherwise stated, they generate prime numbers lazily on demand. These are
supplied for educational purposes and are generally slower or less efficient
than the preferred ``primes()`` generator.

    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    Function        Description
    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    croft()         Yield prime numbers using the Croft Spiral sieve.
    erat(n)         Return primes up to n by the sieve of Eratosthenes.
    sieve()         Yield primes using the sieve of Eratosthenes.
    cookbook()      Yield primes using "Python Cookbook" algorithm.
    wheel()         Yield primes by wheel factorization.
    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------

    .. TIP:: In the current implementation, the fastest of these
       generators is aliased as ``primes()``.


These generators however are extremely slow, and should be considered as
examples of algorithms which should *not* be used, supplied as a horrible
warning of how *not* to calculate primes.

    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    Function            Description
    --------------  --------------------------------------------------------
    awful_primes    Yield primes very slowly by an awful algorithm.
    naive_primes1   Yield primes slowly by a naive algorithm.
    naive_primes2   Yield primes slowly by a less naive algorithm.
    trial_division  Yield primes slowly using trial division.
    turner          Yield primes very slowly using Turner's algorithm.

    ``fermat(n, base)`` is a probabilistic test for primality which returns
    True if integer n is a weak probable prime to the given integer base,
    otherwise n is definitely composite and False is returned.

    ``base`` must be a positive integer between 1 and n-1 inclusive, or a
    tuple of such bases. By default, base=2.

    If ``fermat`` returns False, that is definite proof that n is composite:
    there are no false negatives. However, if it returns True, that is only
    provisional evidence that n is prime. For example:

    >>> fermat(99, 7)
    False
    >>> fermat(29, 7)
    True

    We can conclude that 99 is definitely composite, and state that 7 is a
    witness that 29 may be prime.

    As the Fermat test is probabilistic, composite numbers will sometimes
    pass a test, or even repeated tests:

    >>> fermat(3*11*17, 7)  # A pseudoprime to base 7.
    True

    You can perform multiple tests with a single call by passing a tuple of
    ints as ``base``. The number must pass the Fermat test for all the bases
    in order to return True. If any test fails, ``fermat`` will return False.

    True
    >>> fermat(41041, (17, 23, 356, 359, 363))
    False

    If a number passes ``k`` Fermat tests, we can conclude that the
    probability that it is either a prime number, or a particular type of
    pseudoprime known as a Carmichael number, is at least ``1 - (1/2**k)``.
