<h2>The Python Language</h2>
<p>The Python programming language is available for many hardware
platforms, and most general documentation is Unix- or Windows-centered. Keep
this in mind when reading the rest of this help, or information on the web.
</p>

<p>The Python website, <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>,
has a <em>Beginners Guide</em> section including an 
<a href="http://python.org/doc/essays/blurb.html">executive summary</a> on
the language and a 
<a href="http://python.org/doc/essays/comparisons.html">comparison</a> of Python
to other languages. Or read the (rather longwinded) Python
Tutorial in the <a href="doc/index.html">Python Language and runtime documentation</a>.</p>

<p>MacPython contains a complete <a href="shell.html">unix interpreter</a> so
if you are familiar with Python on unix you should feel right at home.</p>

<h2>MacPython additions</h2>

<p>The MacPython Integrated Development Environment (IDE) allows
easy editing, running and debugging of scripts. Read the 
<a href="ide/index.html">Introduction
to the IDE</a> to whet your appetite.</p>

<p>MacPython comes with lots of modules that allow access to 
MacOS-specific technology, such as Carbon, Quicktime and AppleScript. 
See the <em>Macintosh
Modules</em> section of the
<a href="doc/index.html">Python Language and runtime documentation</a>,
but please keep in mind that some information there still pertains to
Mac OS 9.

Full access to the Cocoa APIs
and tools such as Interface Builder is available separately through the
<a href="packman.html">Package Manager</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="packman.html">Package Manager</a> also gives you access to extension
packages for cross-platform GUI development (Tkinter, wxPython, PyOpenGL), 
image processing (PIL), scientific
computing (Numeric) and much more. <em>PyObjC</em> deserves a special mention: it allows
transparent access to Cocoa and Interface Builder, similar to what Java provides,
thereby making Python a first class citizen in the Mac OS X developer world. </p>

<p>Python scripts can be saved as <em>applets</em>, semi-standalone applications
that work just like a normal application. Additionally you can even create
true standalone application that have everything embedded and can be
shipped to anyone, without the need to install Python. You do <em>not</em>
need to install the Apple Developer Tools for this. </p>
