  abstract = {This article proposes a new method for creating test software for
	object-oriented systems using a genetic programming approach. It
	is believed that this approach is advantageous over the more established
	search-based test-case generation approaches because the test software
	is represented and altered as a fully functional computer program.
	Genetic programming (GP) uses a tree-shaped data structure which
	is more directly comparable and suitable for being mapped instantly
	to abstract syntax trees commonly used in computer languages and
	compilers. These structures can be manipulated and executed directly,
	bypassing intricate and error prone conversion procedures between
	different representations. In addition, tree structures make more
	operations possible, which keep the structure and semantics of the
	evolving test software better intact during program evolution, compared
	to linear structures. This speeds up the evolutionary program generation
	process because the loss of evolved structures due to mutations and
	crossover is prevented more effectively.},
