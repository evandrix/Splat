<H3><A NAME="SECTION004121000000000000000">
2.1.2.1 Why compose and connect?</A>
</H3>

<P>
Is it realistic to expect to be able to define an application entirely in
terms of components?  And why would you want to do it in the first place?
Can't we just write an application the ``old-fashioned way"?  That is,
import the exact components we want, and use them wherever and whenever
we want, instead of creating bindings to link them to a master ``application"
component?

<P>
Well, you could, but one of PEAK's goals is to improve reusability.  Consider
this: all cars have engines, but different models of car have different goals
or requirements for their engines.  If we are creating a ``Car" application,
wouldn't it be nice if we could switch out the ``engine" component when we
get a new project, without having to maintain multiple versions of the code?
Perhaps for this project we need the ``car" to be compact, or perhaps we need
a bigger engine for a station wagon this time.

<P>
How can we achieve such reusability?  It actually requires only a simple
coding convention: never write code in a function or method that directly
references another class.  Instead, define <i>all</i> collaborations with
other classes by way of instance attributes.  This means that collaborating
component classes can be easily substituted in a derived class, substituting
a new ``engine" class, for example.

<P>
While you can apply this technique of ``hiding collaborators" in any
object-oriented language, PEAK takes the approach to a new level.  Because
PEAK attribute bindings can be used to programmatically define connections in
context, components can actually seek out their collaborators dynamically at
runtime, via configuration files or other sources.  This can be as simple
and ubiquitous as looking up what database to connect to, or as complex as
specifying strategy components to select algorithms that are optimal
for a specific deployment environment.

<P>
We're back to the ``ilities" again: reusability, composability, extensibility,
and flexibility, in this case.  (Maybe portability, too.)  We even get a bit
of understandability and maintainability: when we isolate collaborations in
attribute bindings, it becomes a lot easier to implement the <em class="citetitle"
 >Law
of Demeter</em> and write ``adaptive programs".

<P>

<a class="url" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/LoD.html">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/LoD.html</a> has lots of links about the
<em class="citetitle"

">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/demeter-method/LawOfDemeter/object-formulation.html
</a> for its ``object-oriented" version, if you'd like to know more about this
software quality technique.  PEAK takes this ``Law" very seriously, insisting
that code which references even a collaborator class must do so via an
instance attribute or other ``neighbor" as defined by the Law.

<P>
You don't have to know or follow the <em class="citetitle"
 >Law of Demeter</em> to use PEAK.
(Your programs just won't be as flexible.)  But all of our example programs
will obey the Law, so you'll have a chance to see how - and how easy it
is - to follow it.
