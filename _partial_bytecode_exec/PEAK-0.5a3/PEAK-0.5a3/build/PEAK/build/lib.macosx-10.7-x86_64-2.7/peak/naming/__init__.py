"""Object Naming subsystem, analagous to Java's JNDI (javax.naming)

    This package is intended to be a rough equivalent to the 'javax.naming'
    package for implementing JNDI in Java.  The idea is to be a conceptual
    match, rather than a 100% compatible API.  Pythonic naming conventions
    and PEAKish operating idioms are preferred over their Java equivalents.

    To Do (no particular ordering)

        * 'MappingContext', 'FSContext', etc.

        * Directory attribute support, and other remaining interface methods

        * Detailed interface and subclassing docs
