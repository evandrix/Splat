1.1.3 What PEAK is made of: Application Kit</A>
</H2>

<P>
So what are these PEAK technologies? PEAK is an application kit, and
applications are made from components.  PEAK provides you with a
component architecture, component infrastructure, and various
general-purpose components and component frameworks for building
applications. As with J2EE, the idea is to let you stop reinventing
architectural and infrastructure wheels, so you can put more time into
your actual application.

<P>
The most basic part of PEAK is the component binding package: a set of
tools for constructing components out of other components, and ``binding"
separate components together. Then, PEAK supplies a component naming
package that provides a common API for associating names with
components, looking them up by name, and handling ``addresses" of objects
like database connections, mail servers, log or lockfiles, and other
infrastructure components. Third, PEAK supplies a component
configuration package, which makes it easy to provide utilities and
configuration data that ``trickle down" through the components of an
application.

<P>
PEAK also supplies, or will supply, several other packages dealing with
application domain components, storage, transactions,
internationalization, and system operations such as task scheduling,
logging, and so on. But all of these other packages depend on the three
core packages of binding, naming, and configuration, which are the
subject of this tutorial.  Understanding how to use these core packages
is essential for building PEAK applications.

<P>
Luckily, PEAK is compact. At the time we started writing this, the binding,
naming, and config packages consisted of only about 4,000 lines of Python
(including docstrings, comments, and whitespace, but not counting unit
test modules or shared utility modules). So it won't take you long to
master their use, with the help of this tutorial.
