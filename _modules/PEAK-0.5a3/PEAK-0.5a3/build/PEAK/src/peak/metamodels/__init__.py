"""Metamodelling/CASE Tools

Misc. To-do (mostly TransWarp leftovers)

  * Add ASDL model of the Python language

  * Helper methods in Elements & Services for marshalling, common queries, etc.

  * Code generation framework
    
    - Tagged values in stereotypes vs. main values?

    - Should tagged values be copied directly into templates?  Treated as
      Python expressions?

    - Should Services be generated using an Element class' "static"
      (class-scope) methods/attributes?

      - Are association-ends scoped?

      - Would it be better to seperate them?

    - What determines whether an implemented Service actually stores objects
      or delegates this to its subclass services?

  * Simple demo (browse XMI model via the web)
