<key name="StopAfter" attribute="stopAfter" datatype="time-interval">
    <description>
    After this many seconds, stop and exit the application as soon as the
    active task completes.  Defaults to 0, which means never stop.
    </description>
</key>

<key name="IdleTimeout" attribute="idleTimeout" datatype="time-interval">
    <description>
    Stop and exit the application as soon as it has been idle (i.e. no
    'activityOccurred()' messages have been sent to the main loop) for this
    many seconds.  Defaults to 0, which means don't check for activity.
    </description>
</key>

<key name="RunAtLeast" attribute="runAtLeast" datatype="time-interval">
    <description>
    Wait this many seconds before enabling the 'IdleTimeout'.  Note that this
    setting has no effect if 'IdleTimeout' is 0.  'RunAtLeats' defaults to
    0, which means idle checking commences immediately.
