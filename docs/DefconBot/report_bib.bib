	abstract = {Developers of game AI are always interested in cramming more complexity into the virtual brains they build. However complexity often has a price, or rather has many prices: poor run-time, poor scalability, a lack of directability and worst of all, a murky experience for the player in which the AIs seem to act "randomly" rather than "intentionally". We will discuss the sources of complexity, the various ways in which complexity can manifest itself and also some of the architectural approaches we took in Halo 2 to mitigate these negative effects. This discussion will center on the problem of scalable decision-making, but will also touch on questions of memory, knowledge model, and control representations for the scripting and influencing of the AI by level designers.},
