1.1.1 What PEAK is for: Enterprise Applications</A>
</H2>

<P>
Enterprise applications are complex, reflecting the complexity of the
environments they exist in and support. The ``enterprise" is often a
large corporation with many subsidiaries, each of which may have been
acquired as a previously-independent company with its own product lines
and business processes. With each acquisition, an enterprise inherits
new ``legacy" systems, which must be integrated or phased out. Databases
and applications are legion, system administration is vital. There are
multiple developers, some inside the company, some outside, some from
different divisions. Repetition is everywhere, but also variation. For
example: the New York database is on the same back-end as the one in
London, but the data model is slightly different, and the time zones on
stored dates are different. One thing doesn't vary, however: the users
want new functionality, and they want it yesterday.

<P>
In such an environment, non-functional requirements - the ``ilities" of
development - reign supreme. Reusability, configurability, flexibility,
extensibility, reliability, portability: these are the stuff
``enterprise" applications must be made of. The authors of PEAK have
built their professional reputations not only on their applications'
reliabilty, but on their speed of development as well. So PEAK
incorporates their best ideas for making application components highly
reusable, extensible, and configurable, ``right out of the box".
