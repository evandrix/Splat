<P>
The value proposition of J2EE is that you can have industry standards,
whose implementations are supplied by competing vendors, to address
the ``ilities" across a variety of concerns, such as data storage,
component assembly, messaging systems, and so on.  But J2EE encompasses
over a dozen technologies of varying complexity and immense APIs.  Java
is also not a compact language, nor is it especially suited to rapid
development.  Last, but not least, the sheer scope of J2EE ensures that
implementations are resource-hungry, and complex to install, manage, and
maintain, especially for the smaller enterprise, or small department
within a larger enterprise.  If you wish to do more with less, J2EE is
probably not for you.

<P>
Python, on the other hand, is an easy-to-use language that ``fits your
brain", and comes with ``batteries included".  Often an idea that takes
half a dozen classes and several hundred lines of convoluted code to
express in Java, can be expressed in two classes and less than a hundred
lines of crystal-clear Python.  Indeed, Python is so expressive that it
can take far less time for one to write an alternative implementation of
a J2EE technology in Python, than it takes to understand that technology
in the first place!  Many J2EE technology concepts were actually
developed independently in Python applications and libraries, long
before they appeared in Java.  But, compared to Java's marketing
juggernaut, Python tools for the enterprise have had relatively little
market exposure.

<P>
And so, there is an increasing movement in the Python world to develop
and/or promote serious alternatives to J2EE technologies for use with
Python, so that developers can leverage Python's lower total cost of
ownership in application development and maintenance. The authors of
PEAK see PEAK as part of this larger ``Python Enterprise" movement, along
with the Zope 3 application server, and other Python APIs and
technologies. Zope 3 can be seen as an alternative to Java servlets,
JSP, and EJB containers for ``session beans" and ``message-driven beans".
PEAK supplies tools for creating the equivalents of ``managed beans" and
``entity beans", and for implementing parallels to other J2EE technologies
such as JNDI and JMS.  It is designed to integrate well with the Zope 3
object publishing architecture, and with other Python Enterprise
technologies. (A detailed comparison of all the technologies in the J2EE
and Python Enterprise worlds is outside the scope of this tutorial, but
may be addressed later in a separate white paper.)
