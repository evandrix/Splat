Branches defined specifically for the ZConfig package are listed
below.  The canonical version of this list is on the HEAD of the
ZConfig package.

zconfig-brace-syntax
    NOT ACTIVE
    An example of an alternate syntax for ZConfig.  This syntax was
    developed while trying the package initially, but was rejected.
    It is saved on a branch to avoid losing historical information.

zconfig-schema-devel-branch
    NOT ACTIVE
    Development branch for schema support in ZConfig.  The branch is
    based on the ZConfig trunk, but the development is strongly based
    on the work Chris McDonough started in the chrism-install-branch
    for Zope 2.  This was merged into the trunk on 3-Jan-2002.
